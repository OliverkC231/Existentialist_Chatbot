This project compares three different chatbots trained on the writing of existentialist philosphers to see how the LLMs responses change with RAG.

The three models include a bot running just an Ollama LLM without RAG, an Ollama model with RAG, and an OPENAI GPT-5.1 model with RAG.

To run the code, install a venv and add your API keys.
